# iOS Refresh Control (UIRefreshControl)
"A UIRefreshControl object provides a standard control that can be used to initiate the refreshing of a table view’s contents. You link a refresh control to a table through an associated table view controller object. The table view controller handles the work of adding the control to the table’s visual appearance and managing the display of that control in response to appropriate user gestures." https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIRefreshControl_class/
